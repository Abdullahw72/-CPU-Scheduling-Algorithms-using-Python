# CPU Scheduling Algorithm

Disclaimer: This was a Entry Level Project, based on Python and PyQt5, which I worked on in my Fifth Semester in Bahria University Karachi Campus.

This Project includes:
- Python Implementation of Basic OS Scheduling Algorithms
- UI Implementation using PyQt5


The primary objective of this project is to show our understanding of the concepts 
of this project, scheduling algorithms, as well as show how all these algorithms 
work in the backend of an operating system. 

The user will enter the burst and 
arrival times and the program will show AVG Waiting and Turnaround Times, along with Gantt chart. 

This 
will help a user understand how an algorithm is performing and which one would 
be the best suited for their problem.


Note: Python 3.9 is required to run this project.
